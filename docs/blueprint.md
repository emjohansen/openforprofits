## Original User Request:
I want to create a simple and clean webapp that lets users calculate if a business idea is valid and profitable economic-wise. Act like a master in business economics and financial stuff, and also act like a master developer and designer. Include all neccecary data to evaluate if the business is profitable, but let the user input their numbers. Please give the users alot of flexability (so that it can cover all different industries) and have many optional and toggles. But make sure its simple and clean.

Make sure it has both the following features.
1. After the user has inputted all data it says if its profitable or not
2. After the user has inputted some data it says how many sales, or how much it need to take per sale etc it need to be able to be profitable
